> The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition (K&R)

## The K&R Book

The K&R book set a standard which showed what C was great at, it got you far enough to truly understand the    language, and all you were left with was the computer science and the specific libraries the book didn’t  include. By the time you were done, there was no question as to what the core language could and couldn’t do.

> Kernighan and Ritchie’s C Programming Language isn’t just a good programming book, it is a model of how technical writing should be.

## Why I Should Learn C? And Why K&R Book?

In the first, you will not find me set in peace if I don't understand very well what is going on "***under the hood***" for what concepts or anything that faced me and I really cares about it.

So a mind like this will always put you in trouble if your professional career is in one of the ***STEM*** domains like meine. :v::sweat_smile:

And during my journey to learning what is going on "***under the hood***" of a ***Computer System***.
I was directed to read [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](<https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/ref=asc_df_013409266X/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312045876164&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12521604797624836547&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2840&hvtargid=pla-434658419254&psc=1>) book (credit goes to ***Uncle Tango***) :love_you_gesture::sunglasses:.

The book's aim is to explain the enduring concepts underlying all computer systems and to show you the concrete ways that these ideas affect the correctness, performance, and utility of your application programs. 

And be prepared to delve deeper, studying such topics as compilers, computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, and networking.

The book assumes some familiarity with C or C++, And fortunately, the book authors recommended ***K&R*** textbook when they said:

> Fortunately, C is a small language, and it is clearly and beautifully described in the classic “K&R” text by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie [58]. Regardless of your programming background, consider K&R an essential part of your personal systems library.

After that, I find my mind fell in love with this book.

So my digging tools :hammer_and_wrench::screwdriver: for Computer Systems :computer: is ***C Programming Language*** :metal::nerd_face:
