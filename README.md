> The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition (K&R)

The K&R book set a standard which showed what C was great at, it got you far enough to truly understand the language, and all you were left with was the computer science and the specific libraries the book didn’t include. By the time you were done, there was no question as to what the core language could and couldn’t do.

> Kernighan and Ritchie’s C Programming Language isn’t just a good programming book, it is a model of how technical writing should be.

I'm very curious to know "what's going on under the hood", so I choose C for digging :)

This repository contains my programming solutions to The K&R book (The C Programming Language).

> NOTE: Here is a working solution to exercises that involves only concepts introduced up to the point of the exercise.
