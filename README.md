The C Programming Language Exercises. (ANSI C)

C is a small, simple language.The design was controlled by a single person, rather than a committee,
and the result was a clean, consistent design with little baggage. The K&R book describes the
complete language and standard library, with numerous examples and exercises, in only 261 pages.
The simplicity of C made it relatively easy to learn and to port to different computers.

This repository contains my solutions to The K&R book (The C Programming Language).
