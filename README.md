> The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition (K&R)

C is a small, simple language.The design was controlled by a single person, rather than a committee,
and the result was a clean, consistent design with little baggage. The K&R book describes the
complete language and standard library, with numerous examples and exercises, in only 261 pages.
The simplicity of C made it relatively easy to learn and to port to different computers.

> Kernighan and Ritchie’s C Programming Language isn’t just a good programming book, it is a model of how technical writing should be.

C is a middle-level PL (not a low-level PL, as most of the uninformed people say). When people talk about it you�ll hear
phrases like �coding to the metal,� or �coding close to the wire.� C is the language of compilers, interpreters, editors, 
operating systems and embedded programming. When you learn to program in C you almost have to gain an understanding of how
programs execute. You know what things like register, stack, heap, and memory mapped IO mean.

I'm very curious to know "what's going on under the hood", so I choose C for digging :)

This repository contains my programming solutions to The K&R book (The C Programming Language).

NOTE: Here is a working solution to exercises that involves only concepts introduced up to the point of the exercise.
